##Project :Tigrigna translator 
Almost all the languages in the world are embedded in Google language translation. Despite  most people in the world can translate their mother-language to different other languages, Eritreans cannot. That’s why  we are really passionate to tackle this problem for Eritreans who need to translate any language to Tigrigna and vice-versa.

##Aim of the project
To  translate Tigrigna (Eritrean language) to English and and possibly Dutch  online.

##Development approaches  already done  
There are list of words for the language English and Dutch, and there is private websites which  serve as a stand alone Tigrigna dictionary but the previous website has many shortcomings.

##Why the project is needed
Since there are many shortcomings of the previous web site for Tigrigna translation, we are  excited to do a new Tigrigna dictionary.  
Finally the aim of this project is that  any person who needs to translate to Tigrigna and from Tigrigna to other languages will  confidently do his work. There are plenty of reasons to do this project. One of these are the problem encountered on the previous website.  
Some shortcomings of the previous Tigrigna website are:
*  It  hasn’t all Tigrigna words.
*  It is a stand alone websites so you cannot switch to different languages except English. 
*  You need to pay to access the website.
