#Project Proposal 

##Project Overview

Almost all the languages in the world are embedded in Google language translation. Despite most people in the world can translate their mother-language to different other languages, Eritreans cannot. That’s why we are really passionate to tackle this problem for Eritreans who need to translate any language to Tigrigna and vice-versa.

##Aim of the project
To translate Tigrigna (Eritrean language) to English and possibly Dutch online.

##Development approaches of the project already done  
There are list of words for the language English and Dutch, and there is private websites which serve as a standalone Tigrigna dictionary but this private  website has many shortcomings. So our project will eliminate all these shortcomings and will try to feel our users’ satisfactions.

##Why the project is needed to be done
Since there are many shortcomings and limitations of the previous web site of Tigrigna translation, we are excited to do a new Tigrigna dictionary with all necessary requirements.  
Finally the aim of our project is that any person, who needs to translate to Tigrigna and from Tigrigna to other languages, will confidently do his work.
We have special reasons to do this project. One of these is the problem encountered on the previous website.  
Some shortcomings of the previous Tigrigna website are:
*  It  hasn’t all Tigrigna words.
*  It is a standalone websites so you cannot switch to different languages except English. 

##Implementation of the project
